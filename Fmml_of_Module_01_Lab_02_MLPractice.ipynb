        "Stratified Split:\n",
        "\n",
        "If your dataset has class imbalance or specific patterns you want to ensure are adequately represented in both training and validation sets, consider using a stratified split. This ensures that each subset (training, validation, test) maintains a similar class distribution to the original dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "For very large datasets, you might be able to allocate a smaller percentage to the validation and test sets while still having a sufficient number of samples for evaluation. Conversely, for small datasets, you should prioritize larger validation and test sets to ensure a representative evaluation.\n",
        "In summary, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, and the split should be chosen based on the specific characteristics of your dataset and problem. Experimentation and iterative evaluation are key to finding the optimal split that balances the need for training data and accurate model evaluation.\n",
